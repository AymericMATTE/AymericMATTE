## About Me
I'm Sayanel or Aymeric for those who want to use my name. I'm currently a student in video game developement, more precisely i really like creating and developing engine like game engine not the real thing that cars use to move.

I really love doing game engine, I've done with friends, during our first year at school, a game engine with an GameObject and Component system, an editor and more. And for my internship at the end of my first year, I have passed 2 months doing a game engine for my school for 40 peoples.

That's sayed, I'm very open when it comes to humor and I also love learning new things from my colleague.

I'm currently looking for a computer science stage of 2 months around Lyon or Nancy in France for my second year internship. So if you know someone that could be interested by my profil ....

Thanks for reading my profil, I hope it makes you know more about me !!
